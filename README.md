## Pimcore Platform Version
By default, Pimcore Platform Version is added as a dependency which ensures installation of compatible and in combination 
with each other tested versions of additional Pimcore modules. More information about the Platform Version can be found in the 
[Platform Version docs](https://github.com/pimcore/platform-version). 

It might be necessary to update a specific Pimcore module to a version that is not included in the Platform Version.
In that case, you need to remove the `platform-version` dependency from your `composer.json` and update the module to
the desired version.
Be aware that this might lead to a theoretically compatible but untested combination of Pimcore modules.
